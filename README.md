# CycdUp

Put this repo directory in [OpenFrameworksDir]/apps/myApps/ and compile using xcodebuild on macosx. Not sure if compiles on Linux.

Run synthesis in SuperCollider by opening the CycdUpSynths.scd patch and running the part between brackets. This is done by double clicking on the first open-bracket so that the region between brackets is all selected, then hit "Apple-Enter" in osx. Not sure about Linux SC, but I'm sure it's something like Ctrl-Enter.
